# special of snowflakes

A simple game I made using the pixi.js Engine/Framework I was working on. The framework is mostly a bare-bones GameObjects/Components runner for pixi.js graphics.

I might extend it as I find more uses for it.

The double webpack configs are a vestige from when I was first learning to use webpack, and didn't want to learn about all the environment variable things.

Kongregate integration is in the code because that's where I pushed the sample.
